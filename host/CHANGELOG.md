# host

## 1.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b189f4c: Add MCP (Model Context Protocol) server endpoint at `/api/mcp`. Auto-generates tools from the API's OpenAPI spec, proxying to existing oRPC routes in-process. Supports API key and session auth. Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/server` + `@modelcontextprotocol/hono` v2 with stateless Streamable HTTP transport.

## 1.13.6

### Patch Changes

- a49c930: Set `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` on static asset responses (favicon, og:image, manifest, etc.) so social media crawlers and link-preview tools can load them cross-origin. HTML and API responses retain `same-origin` CORP.
- 9d8b671: Strip `etag`/`last-modified` and override `cache-control` on proxied static assets to prevent Cloudflare from serving stale headers via 304 revalidation. Sets `cache-control: public, max-age=14400, s-maxage=300` (no `stale-while-revalidate`) so the CDN always does a full GET after 5 min, guaranteeing fresh response headers.
- cf711d7: Extracted health/memory profiling into `host/src/routes/health.ts`. `/api/_health` now includes `memory` (rss, heapTotal, heapUsed, external in bytes + MB) and per-plugin metadata (key, name, remoteUrl, version). New `/api/_memory` endpoint accepts `?gc=true` to force GC before returning the memory snapshot. Documented `DB_POOL_MAX`, `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` in `.env.example`.

## 1.13.5

### Patch Changes

- 9a0220e: Simplify CSRF middleware: remove origin/referer whitelist and rely on Host header matching. Same-origin requests pass automatically (covering all tenant domains), no-Origin requests pass through (non-browser clients), and cross-origin POSTs from unserved origins are blocked.

## 1.13.4

### Patch Changes

- fee6577: Fixed production host binding to port 443 (derived from the HTTPS CDN URL) instead of the planned listening port (3000, or `--port` flag value). The planner already resolved the correct port, but the `start` command discarded `plan.runtimeConfig` and stored the original — whose `host.port` came from `parsePort(remoteUrl)`. Now `start` uses `plan.runtimeConfig` so each app binds to its allocated port. Also stops deriving the listening port from the remote URL in `buildRuntimeConfig` for production; uses `DEFAULT_HOST_PORT` and lets the planner override.

## 1.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 3f44bbb: Fixed SSR crash in `bos dev` with remote host and local UI without `--ssr` — the host no longer attempts SSR from the browser dev server (which doesn't serve `remoteEntry.server.js`). SSR is only attempted when an SSR URL is explicitly configured.

  Fixed silent error suppression in the host API router interceptor — `formatORPCError` output is now properly `console.error`'d, matching the publicRpcRouters pattern.

  Fixed `formatORPCError` box-drawing output to split messages on newlines and re-prefix each line with `│`, preventing misalignment when Drizzle's `Failed query` messages (which contain `\n`) are surfaced. The underlying PostgreSQL error is now visible in the error box.

  Fixed framework-level scope lifecycle bug where `Layer.scoped` resources created in plugin `initialize` with `Effect.provide(...)` were tied to a transient scope and released immediately after initialization. Database pools and other long-lived scoped resources now persist correctly.

  Added `PluginServicesTools` with a `buildService(tag, layer)` helper that builds scoped resources using `Layer.buildWithMemoMap` bound to the plugin lifecycle scope. Resources are automatically released on plugin shutdown.

  Added `registerPlugin()` lifecycle tracking — initialized plugins are now registered with `PluginLifecycleService` so `shutdown()` and `cleanup()` correctly release plugin resources.

  Fixed `evictPlugin()` cache key mismatch — eviction now uses the same key generation as `usePlugin`, so eviction correctly finds and shuts down cached plugins.

  Added a per-plugin `MemoMap` for deduplicated layer construction when using `tools.buildService`.

## 1.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 58272ad: Refactor plugin bootstrap to Effect-native error channel and route `CORS_ORIGIN` through Effect's `Config` primitive.

  - `host/src/services/plugins.ts`: `initializePlugins` splits the single `Effect.tryPromise` into a narrow host-infra `tryPromise` (→ `PluginError`) plus per-phase `Effect.gen` steps for auth / non-api plugins / api. Each phase catches `PluginBootstrapError` via `Effect.catchTag` and routes through one shared `logBootstrapError` helper, collapsing three duplicated catch blocks. DB URL secrets now read via `Config.secret` + `Secret` (raw value only touched via `Secret.value` at the masking point); missing env maps to `Secret("unset")` through `catchAll`. `PluginBootstrapError` gains a `message` getter matching the `errors.ts` pattern. Logging inside Effect-managed regions moved to `yield* Effect.logInfo/logError`.
  - `host/src/services/plugins.ts`: `buildAuthBaseVariables` simplified — removes dead `/remoteEntry.js`/`/mf-manifest.json` regex stripping (those URLs live on `config.host.entry`, never `config.host.url`) and the redundant `localhost:3000` double-fallback. Dev uses `config.host?.url ?? localhost:PORT`, prod uses `config.domain` (the public ingress, not the Zephyr URL which lives in the separate `config.host.remoteUrl` field).
  - `host/src/services/config.ts`: added `readCorsOrigins()` using `Config.array(Config.string(), "CORS_ORIGIN")` with `ConfigProvider.fromEnv`, filtering empty entries, `catchAll` fallback to `[]`.
  - `host/src/services/program.ts`: single `yield* readCorsOrigins()` at the top of `createStartServer` replaces both the warning-presence check and the `allowedOrigins` parse. One env read instead of two.
  - `host/src/services/plugins.ts`: `buildAuthBaseVariables` now takes `corsOrigins: string[]`; auth phase reads via `yield* readCorsOrigins()`. Removes the inline `process.env.CORS_ORIGIN?.split(",")` read.

  Behavior changes for `CORS_ORIGIN` edge cases (both more correct): `CORS_ORIGIN=''` now resolves to `[]` (was `[""]`), so the production warning fires for empty string and `allowedOrigins` falls through to host/ui fallback. `CORS_ORIGIN='a,,b'` now resolves to `["a","b"]` (was `["a","","b"]`).

  No public API changes. `PluginResult` shape unchanged. `bun typecheck` clean, biome lint clean, 124/124 host tests pass.

- 58272ad: Fix metadata files being blocked by narrowed static asset regex; standardize public file structure; renderClientShell delegates head data to UI's getRouteHead.

  - `host/src/program.ts`: Added `md` and `webmanifest` to `staticAssetPattern` (fixes regression from DDoS narrowing that blocked `.md` and `.webmanifest` from being proxied as static assets). DRY'd inline regex copy to use the named constant.
  - `host/src/program.ts`: Refactored `renderClientShell` to accept `HeadData` from the MF-loaded UI router module via `getRouteHead`. Host no longer hardcodes metadata (favicon, manifest, OG tags) — the UI's `__root.tsx` `head()` is the single source of truth. Minimal fallback shell (charset, viewport, title, boot scripts) when module is unavailable.
  - `packages/everything-dev/src/ui/router.ts`: Added `serializeHeadData` helper to convert structured `HeadData` (meta/links/scripts) to HTML strings for the raw shell.
  - `ui/public/`: Standardized on 15-file public structure. Renamed icon.svg→near.svg, icon_rev.svg→near_rev.svg, android-chrome-192x192.png→web-app-manifest-192x192.png, android-chrome-512x512.png→web-app-manifest-512x512.png. Generated favicon-96x96.png, logo.png. Removed legacy files (favicon-16x16.png, favicon-32x32.png, logo192.png, logo512.png, logo_rev.svg, logo.svg, manifest.json). Replaced manifest.json with site.webmanifest as single PWA manifest.
  - `ui/src/routes/__root.tsx`: Updated icon and manifest references to match new filenames.
  - `ui/public/site.webmanifest`: Merged richer icon set and fields from old manifest.json.

- 58272ad: Security and correctness fixes from codebase audit:

  - **Require `API_DATABASE_URL` in production** — Removed the `:memory:` PGlite default from the API plugin schema. Uses a Zod `refine()` that rejects `pglite:` URLs when `NODE_ENV=production`, preventing silent data loss on restart. Updated `drizzle.config.ts` fallback to throw in production.
  - **Add warnings to empty catch blocks** — Added `console.warn` to 5 empty `catch {}` blocks across `config.ts` (\_resolved.json parse, package.json name resolution), `orchestrator.ts` (manifest fetch failure), and `cli/upgrade.ts` (plugin config parse and file deletion), turning silent fallbacks into actionable diagnostics.
  - **Add CSRF protection middleware** — Added `createCsrfMiddleware` to the host server that validates `Origin`/`Referer` headers against the allowed origins list for state-changing methods (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH), preventing cross-origin request forgery on cookie-authenticated endpoints.

## 1.13.1

### Patch Changes

- b03bc24: **every-plugin:**

  - Broaden `Effect.annotateLogs({ plugin: pluginId })` to cover the full plugin lifecycle — `usePlugin`, `loadPlugin`, `instantiatePlugin`, and `initializePlugin` — so all logs including Module Federation operations and database migrations are tagged with the plugin's registry key
  - Convert Module Federation service `console.log` calls to `Effect.logDebug` (registering/loading) and `Effect.logInfo` (registered/loaded) with proper log levels
  - Refactor `formatORPCError` to return `string | null` instead of calling `console.error` directly, enabling callers to log through Effect's structured system
  - Make `toPluginRuntimeError` and `wrapORPCError` pure functions (no side effects); add `Effect.tapError` with `Effect.logError` at 4 call sites in `plugin-loader.service.ts` for plugin-aware error logging
  - Remove `formatPluginError` (dead code after purity refactor)
  - Remove redundant `Effect.annotateLogs` from `plugin-loader.service.ts` (now covered at runtime level)

  **api:**

  - Convert 3 startup `console.log` calls to `Effect.logInfo` so `[API]` startup messages gain the `plugin=api` annotation
  - Convert `Effect.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for shutdown

  **host:**

  - Import `logger` wrapper in `plugins.ts` and replace all raw `console.*` calls with `logger.*` (for async contexts) or `Effect.log*` (for Effect generator contexts)
  - Restructure `catchAll` block to `Effect.gen` for proper `Effect.logError`/`Effect.logWarning` usage
  - Fix 2 stray `console.*` calls in `program.ts` to use `logger`

  **@everything-dev/apps-plugin:**

  - Convert `console.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for startup message
  - Convert `Effect.log` to `Effect.logInfo` for shutdown

  **@every-plugin/template:**

  - Convert publish failure `console.log` to `Effect.logWarning` for proper log level and annotation
  - Remove `[Event]` debug `console.log` from streaming handler; use `getEventMeta` for meaningful event ID filtering instead
  - Restructure `getById` to `Effect.gen` wrapper with `Effect.logInfo` for service call logging

## 1.13.0

### Minor Changes

- e41dc82: Add DDoS protection middleware to host server

  Adds three layers of DDoS defense to the Hono host server, applied at the edge before any expensive work:

  - **Rate limiter** (`hono-rate-limiter`): 300 requests per 15-min window per IP, skips health checks and static assets. Uses `x-forwarded-for` behind proxy, falls back to socket IP. Configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` and `RATE_LIMIT_MAX`.

  - **Body limit** (`hono/body-limit`): 10 MB max on API POST/PUT/PATCH payloads. Configurable via `BODY_LIMIT_MAX`.

  - **API timeout** (`hono/timeout`): 30s timeout on API routes only (not SSR streaming). Configurable via `API_TIMEOUT_MS`.

  Also fixes three SSR test failures by adding auth runtime configuration to test helpers used by `runtime-remote.test.ts` and `ssr-bundled-runtime.test.ts`.

- 1368467: Remove auto-generated plugin-sidebar system in favor of manual sidebar items in `_layout.tsx`

  Deleted the entire `sidebar.ts` code generator, `SidebarItem`/`SidebarRole` types, all
  `sidebar` fields from config/resolution schemas, the `plugin-sidebar.gen.ts` generated file,
  and all sidebar migration/passthrough logic in the CLI, host runtime, and tenant runtime.
  Sidebar items are now defined inline in `ui/src/routes/_layout.tsx`.

## 1.12.2

### Patch Changes

- d2d31e7: refactor(host): clean up auth type boundaries and inlined private functions

  - Moved HonoEnv definition from lib/auth.ts into program.ts, where the app
    is assembled. services/auth.ts now uses a self-contained AuthMiddlewareEnv.
  - Inlined toAuthClientContext and resolveAuthEntry into their sole call sites.
  - Simplified AuthServices to a direct re-export from generated types.
  - Tightened registerAuthHandler's app parameter from `{ on: any }` to `Hono<AuthMiddlewareEnv>`.

- e1f7ff7: fix(everything-dev): restore full AuthRequestContext type from auth plugin contract

  The generated AuthRequestContext type was overriding the full organization
  envelope (member, org metadata, isPersonal, hasOrganization) from the auth
  plugin's getContext() with a narrower { activeOrganizationId } stub. This
  caused type drift between the runtime context and the type system.

  - Remove handwritten organization/apiKey overlay from AuthRequestContext in
    api-contract.ts generator and cli/init.ts scaffold template
  - AuthRequestContext now aliases RawAuthRequestContext directly, preserving
    the full contract shape

  fix(api): add requireOrgRole middleware for organization-level role checks

  Reads context.organization.member.role from the host-injected context.
  No extra round-trips, no type casts, no caching.

  fix(api): remove dead requireUser middleware and AuthenticatedContext type

  requireUser was functionally identical to requireAuth (same condition,
  different error message) and never imported anywhere. AuthenticatedContext
  was defined but never used by any route handler.

  fix(api): correct misleading requireAuth hint

  requireAuth said "Sign in or provide an API key" but never checked for
  API keys. Now says "Sign in to continue". Only requireAuthOrApiKey
  accepts either auth method.

  feat(api): requireAuthOrApiKey now accepts optional permission checks

  requireAuthOrApiKey() — no args, same behavior as before (session or any
  API key). requireAuthOrApiKey({ resource: ["action"] }) — session passes
  through without permission checks, API key requests are scoped to the
  specified permissions. Call site updated to requireAuthOrApiKey().

  fix(host): remove redundant AuthServices interface

  interface AuthServices extends GeneratedAuthServices { auth: ... } re-declared
  auth with the same inherited type. Replaced with type AuthServices = GeneratedAuthServices.

  fix(\_template): remove requireAuth from scaffold plugin

  The template's requireAuth only checked context.userId (not context.user)
  and its userId re-set was a no-op. getById is now public.

## 1.12.1

### Patch Changes

- bb8410e: Fix integrity monitor false positives for extended remotes. When a composable entry (auth, plugin) uses `extends`, its integrity hash is resolved from the parent config at startup. If the parent is redeployed, the running host's monitor checked against the stale hash. Now stores `extendsRef` on RuntimeConfig entries so the monitor can re-fetch the parent config from FastKV to get the latest integrity before verifying. Also runs the first integrity check immediately instead of waiting for the first interval tick.

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- d46dbee: Pass full organization and NEAR context from host to plugins

  The host's `buildPluginContext()` now forwards the complete `organization`
  and `near` objects from the auth plugin's `getContext()`, not just the
  flat `organizationId` and `walletAddress` strings.

  **Host:**

  - Store full `contextResult.organization` and `contextResult.near` in
    Hono context variables during session middleware
  - Pass both objects through `buildPluginContext()` to all plugins

  **API plugin:**

  - Add `organization` and `near` zod schemas to the context schema so
    routes and middleware can access org metadata (including `daoAccountId`
    from `organization.organization.metadata`) and NEAR capabilities

  **Template & Settings plugins:**

  - Expand context schema to reflect the full surface of available fields:
    `user`, `organization` (with `organization`, `member`, `isPersonal`,
    `hasOrganization`), `near` (with `primaryAccountId`, `linkedAccounts`,
    `hasNearAccount`), `walletAddress`, and `apiKey`
  - Added documentation comment listing all available context fields

  **CLI (everything-dev):**

  - Fix type error in `resolveRemoteConfigChain` where `BosConfig` was
    passed as `BosConfigInput` to `mergeBosConfigWithExtends`
  - Update plugin-development SKILL.md with a comprehensive Request Context
    Reference section documenting all fields, common patterns, and the
    minimal context pattern

## 1.11.3

### Patch Changes

- f0f78e4: Fix /api white page on tenant subdomains and CSP strict mode

  - **Proxy mode predicate**: Changed `isProxyMode` from `!!apiConfig.proxy` to
    `process.argv.includes("--proxy")`. Proxy mode now activates via the `--proxy`
    CLI flag only, not from `api.proxy` being set in the config.
  - **Nonce injection in handleOrpc**: After the OpenAPI handler returns an HTML
    response (Scalar UI), inject nonce attributes into `<script>` tags for CSP
    compliance. This fixes the white page when visiting `/api` in production with
    strict CSP (scripts blocked without nonce).
  - **Middleware bypass**: Added `pathname === "/api"` to the asset proxy
    middleware bypass list so exact `/api` requests aren't accidentally proxied
    to the UI assets server.
  - **SSR handler guard**: Added early return in the catch-all SSR handler for
    API paths (`/api` and `/api/*`) to prevent failed SSR rendering of API
    routes.

## 1.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 4761f96: Narrow static asset extension regex to prevent false positives on non-asset routes containing dots

## 1.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 94ad10d: Host now injects `trustedOrigins` from `CORS_ORIGIN` env var into the auth plugin's base variables, aligning Better Auth's CSRF/origin checks with the host's CORS policy. Explicit `auth.variables.trustedOrigins` in `bos.config.json` still takes precedence.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 36b6cd7: Fix deployment workflows to publish updated `bos.config.json` with the `bos publish --deploy` path.

### Patch Changes

- 36b6cd7: Tighten CSP nonce handling across SSR, hydration, and fallback shells, and fix the BOS viewer bootstrap path.
- 36b6cd7: Restore public plugin RPC routing for the browser API contract and keep SSR/client hydration aligned under strict CSP.

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ccdb28: Ensure the deploy workflow checks out the triggering commit before publishing deployment URL updates.

## 1.9.3

### Patch Changes

- 3af34db: Version asset URLs to prevent stale-cache chunk failures

  Client boot assets (`remoteEntry.js`, `style.css`, plugin UI remote entries) now include a `?v=<integrity>` query parameter matching the SSR pattern. This ensures browsers and CDNs serve the correct asset set after each deploy, eliminating `ChunkLoadError` caused by cached `remoteEntry.js` referencing async chunks that no longer exist on the upstream deployment.

  Also fixes the `_viewer` regex from invalid `/^/+/` to `/^\/+/`.

## 1.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 684bcab: Fix production CSP, viewer, and sign-out bugs

  - **CSP nonce**: pass `cspNonce` to `ThemeProvider` so the `next-themes` inline bootstrap script satisfies `script-src 'nonce-...'`. Without this, the browser blocks the script, causing a React hydration mismatch (#418) and cascading failures.
  - **Viewer regex**: fix invalid regex `/^/+/` in `_viewer` HTML template to `/^\/+/` so `widgetPath` leading slashes are correctly stripped instead of causing a SyntaxError.
  - **Sign-out navigation**: add `router.invalidate()` before `navigate()` in both `UserNav` and `SecuritySettings` sign-out handlers. Without this, TanStack Router's `beforeLoad` auth guards read stale session state and redirect back to the login page instead of the home page.

## 1.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8ef8f56: Only expose the API plugin's router publicly on `/api`

  Plugin routers (registry, projects, etc.) are no longer mounted as separate HTTP endpoints on `/api/<plugin>`. Only the API plugin contract is served, providing a single unified OpenAPI spec at `/api/spec.json` and Scalar docs at `/api`. Other plugins remain accessible internally via `pluginsClient` for server-to-server composition.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `/api/<plugin>` routes (e.g. `/api/registry`, `/api/projects`) no longer serve plugin REST/RPC endpoints
  - `/api/rpc/<plugin>/<procedure>` paths no longer route to plugin RPC procedures
  - Individual plugin OpenAPI specs and docs pages are no longer available
  - When the API plugin is unavailable, all `/api/*` routes return 503 instead of per-plugin 503s

- 8ef8f56: Fix `createPluginsClient` to use Proxy composition instead of `Object.assign`, which silently dropped Proxy-resolved RPC methods from the API client
- 8ef8f56: Replace UI asset 302 redirects with reverse proxy to fix Cloudflare 403 errors

  The host now proxies all UI public assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts, favicons) through the host origin instead of 302-redirecting browsers to the Zephyr CDN. This eliminates cross-origin requests that Cloudflare blocks with 403 errors.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `RenderOptions.assetsUrl` removed from `everything-dev/ui/types` — assets are now served from the host origin via root-relative paths
  - `RouterContext.assetsUrl` removed from `everything-dev/ui/types` — no longer needed since assets resolve through the host proxy
  - `getRemoteEntryScript()` removed from `everything-dev/ui/head` — use `getRemoteScripts()` which now returns `{ src: "/remoteEntry.js" }`
  - `RemoteScriptsOptions.assetsUrl` removed — `getRemoteScripts()` no longer needs an assets URL
  - `UnderConstruction` component: `assetsUrl` prop removed — images use rspack module imports directly
  - `ClientRuntimeConfig.assetsUrl` now set to the host origin (`requestUrl.origin`) instead of the CDN URL — existing consumers should note this value change

  **What changed:**

  - Host: `isUiPublicAssetPath()` deleted, logic inlined; `redirectUiAssetRequest()` replaced with `proxyUiAssetRequest()` using `proxyRequest()`
  - Host: `renderClientShell()` uses root-relative paths (`/favicon.ico`, `/remoteEntry.js`) instead of CDN URLs
  - Host: Plugin UI `<script>` tags use `/__mf/plugin-ui/${key}/remoteEntry.js` proxy paths
  - Host: `buildRuntimeClientConfig` sets `assetsUrl` to `requestUrl.origin`
  - UI: All `${assetsUrl}/path` references replaced with `/path` root-relative paths
  - UI: `new URL(importedAsset, assetsUrl)` pattern removed — rspack module imports used directly
  - UI: `/skill.md` fetched via root-relative path, no `assetsUrl` construction needed

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- dea876c: Remove `cspNonce` from ClientRuntimeConfig, fix SSR asset URLs, dissolve style-chrome

  - **everything-dev**: Remove `cspNonce` from `ClientRuntimeConfigSchema` (was leaking server-only value to client). Add `cspNonce` to `RouterContext`. Remove from `CreateRouterOptions`.
  - **ui**: Fix SSR asset URL mismatch — server `assetPrefix` now uses `bosConfig.app.ui.production` CDN URL instead of `/`, so imported assets resolve to the same absolute URL on both SSR and client. Dissolve `style-chrome.tsx` into `_layout.tsx`. Remove all `useClientValue` calls for runtime config reads (now use `runtimeConfig` from route context directly). Move `cspNonce` from L1 prop into `RouterContext`. Remove `getCspNonce()` from auth client. Add `runtimeConfig` prop to `UnderConstruction`.
  - **host**: Stop merging `cspNonce` into `runtimeConfig` for client shell.

## 1.8.2

### Patch Changes

- d26ed95: Pass CSP nonce through SSR pipeline and redirect UI assets instead of proxying to fix Cloudflare Error 1000

  **CSP nonce passthrough (production CSP script/style blocking fix):**

  The host generated a CSP nonce per request but never forwarded it to TanStack Router's SSR renderer, causing all inline scripts and styles to be blocked by `script-src 'nonce-...' 'strict-dynamic'` in production.

  - **everything-dev/types**: Add `cspNonce?: string` to `CreateRouterOptions` and `RenderOptions` interfaces
  - **everything-dev/types**: Add `cspNonce` to `RenderOptionsWithApi` (inherited from `RenderOptions`)
  - **ui/router.server**: Forward `cspNonce` to TanStack Router as `ssr: { nonce }` in `createRouter` and `renderToStream`
  - **ui/\_\_root**: Apply `nonce` from `useRouter().options.ssr?.nonce` to the `<style>` tag for base styles
  - **host/program**: Remove `as any` cast from `renderToStream` call — `cspNonce` is now a typed property
  - **host/tests**: Add regression tests verifying nonce appears on `<script>` and `<style>` tags when `cspNonce` is provided

  **Cloudflare Error 1000 fix (static asset 403s):**

  When both the host (Railway behind Cloudflare) and UI deployment (Zephyr Cloud behind Cloudflare) are orange-clouded, server-to-server proxying triggers Cloudflare Error 1000 "DNS points to prohibited IP". Browser requests to Zephyr Cloud work fine; only the host's `fetch()` proxy was blocked.

  - **host/program**: Replace `proxyUiAssetRequest` (server-to-server `fetch` proxy) with `redirectUiAssetRequest` (HTTP 302 redirect). The browser follows the redirect directly to the Zephyr Cloud origin, bypassing the Cloudflare-to-Cloudflare proxy loop
  - **ui/style-chrome**: Prefix rspack-imported `built_on.png` and `built_on_rev.png` with `assetsUrl` from runtime config so images load directly from the UI deployment origin instead of through the host
  - **ui/skill**: Use `assetsUrl` instead of `hostUrl` to fetch `/skill.md` directly from the UI origin
  - **host/tests**: Update `ui-public-assets.test.ts` — all UI asset tests now verify 302 redirect behavior instead of proxied content

## 1.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 82db5c4: Require ssrIntegrity for tenant SSR — prevent no-cache-per-request MF instance creation

  Tenant SSR now requires both `ssrUrl` and `ssrIntegrity` to be present. Previously, a whitelisted tenant with `ssrUrl` but no `ssrIntegrity` would bypass the router module cache (`shouldCacheRouterModule` returns false without `ssrIntegrity`), causing a new Module Federation instance to be created on every SSR request — the same pattern that caused the production SSR failure.

  Also fixes pre-existing typecheck errors in host test files (Effect Either narrowing, FederationError type annotation).

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1adfdee: Support account-relative tenant resolution on shared hosts so subdomains derive from the active runtime account instead of `label.near`, and allow nested tenant labels in the resolver and tests. Expose runtime lineage in the apps registry by deriving parent, root, depth, and extendsChain from `extends`, and add registry list filters for parent and root traversal.

### Patch Changes

- dd5a7d4: Fix production SSR by keeping the UI auth client local during server rendering and by resolving SSR-imported asset URLs from the UI remote instead of the host origin.
- 4629b80: Write host deployment URLs back to the root bos.config.json so release publishes can commit updated runtime URLs.

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- b662086: Move the homepage BOS viewer into an isolated iframe surface backed by a host-rendered `/_viewer` page.

  - Update `ui/src/routes/_layout/index.tsx` to load the landing viewer through `/_viewer` while preserving `?path=` support.
  - Add a dedicated host-rendered `/_viewer` endpoint with scoped CSP framing rules so the viewer can run in production without weakening the rest of the app.
  - Bootstrap the NEAR BOS web component from the host page so the requested widget path is forwarded correctly into the viewer runtime.

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 6b72cfd: Add fixed-core tenant UI composition for shared hosts so subdomains can resolve BOS configs per request while keeping the host, auth, and API runtime stable. This also hardens tenant remote integrity verification with bounded streaming, background refresh for asset requests, and safer SSR cache invalidation for updated remotes.

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- ef4a77b: Tighten the host CSP in production by switching to nonce-based script loading with `strict-dynamic` while keeping `unsafe-eval` for Module Federation. Also pass the host-provided CSP nonce into the NEAR auth client so wallet iframe scripts continue to run under the stricter policy.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 521f85e: Fix SSR auth client injection, proxy test mock shape, and test config resolution

  - **host**: Pass `authClient` to SSR `renderToStream` so the host's pre-resolved auth client
    is reused instead of creating a new one from config. Export `toAuthClientContext` for use
    in program.ts. Proxy test mock updated to use correct `initialized.context` shape instead
    of putting handler directly on `initialized`.

  - **everything-dev**: Add optional `authClient` field to `RenderOptionsWithApi` type so
    callers can provide a pre-configured auth client for SSR rendering.

  - **ui**: `renderToStream` now uses `authClient` from render options when provided, falling
    back to `createAuthClient(runtimeConfig)` when not specified.

  - **host/tests**: Replace `process.env`-based `BOS_UI_URL`/`BOS_UI_SSR_URL` with production
    URL fallbacks from `bos.config.json` (`app.ui.production`, `app.ui.ssr`). Add
    `createMockAuthClient` helper returning a null-session auth client for SSR tests. Pass
    `session: null` and `authClient` in test render options to match production SSR semantics.

### Patch Changes

- 212ea6f: Clean up test infrastructure: proxy mock, dead env plumbing, and type cast

  - **host/tests**: Replace 80-line manual `AuthClient` mock with an 8-line
    `Proxy`-based mock that auto-implements any property, making it resilient
    to auth client API changes.
  - **host/tests**: Remove dead `vitest.setup.ts` and its `setupFiles` entry
    from `vitest.config.ts`. The `BOS_UI_URL`/`BOS_UI_SSR_URL` env var
    plumbing was unused after switching `loadTestRuntimeConfig` to read
    production URLs from `bos.config.json`. Simplify `global-setup.ts` to
    just build the UI dist (no HTTP server or env var setup needed).
  - **ui**: Remove unnecessary type cast in `renderToStream` —
    `renderOptions.authClient` is now typed directly via `RenderOptions`.
    Remove unused `AuthClient` type import.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 52bb6cd: Fix spurious `serveStatic: root path './dist' is not found` warning in development by skipping the static file middleware when `./dist` doesn't exist.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 81f2599: Add `title` and `description` fields to `bos.config.json`, runtime config, and `ClientRuntimeInfo`. SEO head metadata now reads `title`/`description` from `runtimeConfig.runtime` instead of hardcoded defaults. Also removes a debug console.log, fixes an outdated comment in app.ts, adds a Dockerfile comment, and adds a workflow comment for FCAK creation.

## 1.5.15

- Updated dependencies [ffa8200]
  - every-plugin@2.5.9

## 1.5.14

### Patch Changes

- 6425196: Upgrade hono to >=4.12.18 to resolve 5 security vulnerabilities (CSS injection, JWT validation, cache leakage, XSS, bodyLimit bypass). Soften CI audit step to warn instead of fail on high/critical findings for build-time-only dependencies.

## 1.5.13

### Patch Changes

- cd7692f: Strengthen the generated auth surface and remove duplicate client facades so downstream packages rely on the canonical typed auth client.
- Updated dependencies [cd7692f]
  - every-plugin@2.5.8

## 1.5.12

### Patch Changes

- e2b4b85: Remove host/api/ui/plugins source from Docker image (loaded remotely at runtime). Remove deprecated `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` environment variable in favor of consistent `BOS_GATEWAY`.

## 1.5.11

### Patch Changes

- 6189953: Compile CLI to standalone binary in Dockerfile for faster cold starts. Remove deprecated `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` environment variable in favor of consistent `BOS_GATEWAY`.
- b193ad6: Fix `reqHeaders` runtime type to be a real `Headers` instance instead of `Record<string, string>`, preventing `TypeError: undefined is not a function` when calling `.get()` in plugin handlers
- Updated dependencies [b193ad6]
  - every-plugin@2.5.7

## 1.5.10

### Patch Changes

- 3a875e2: Fix OpenAPI spec blank page (CSP blocks CDN scripts), host assets 403, and add auth/plugin status to health endpoint

## 1.5.9

### Patch Changes

- 6822f5e: Fix OpenAPI spec page showing blank white screen, add auth/plugin status to health endpoint, and serve host assets locally instead of proxying to UI CDN

## 1.5.8

### Patch Changes

- ba974d4: Fix OpenAPI spec page showing blank white screen and add auth/plugin status to health endpoint
- 05c9fe2: Fix changeset CI errors: replace catalog: protocol for every-plugin dependency so changesets can resolve versions

## 1.5.7

### Patch Changes

- 13f68ff: Inject `getRawBody` and `reqHeaders` into oRPC handler context so plugins can verify webhook signatures

  - Host session middleware now clones the request body before oRPC consumes it, exposing `getRawBody()` in context for raw body access
  - Dev server middleware also injects `reqHeaders` and `getRawBody` (previously passed `context: {}`)
  - API, projects, registry, and template plugins declare `getRawBody` in their context schemas
  - API plugin `reqHeaders` type changed from `z.custom<Record<string, string>>()` to `z.record(z.string(), z.string())` for proper runtime validation

## 1.5.6

### Patch Changes

- 369c59b: Remove redundant auth plugin variables from `bos.config.json` and inject them at runtime instead.

  - **`host/src/services/plugins.ts`**: Added `baseVariables` parameter to `loadPluginEntry` so runtime-derived values can be merged before explicit `variables` from `bos.config.json`. When loading the auth plugin, the host now injects `account` (from `config.account`) and `domain` (from `config.domain`, defaulting to `"localhost:3000"` in development) as base variables. Explicit values in `bos.config.json` still take precedence if present.

  - **`bos.config.json`**: Removed the `app.auth.variables` block. `account`, `hostUrl`, and `uiUrl` are no longer required here since the host provides `account` and `domain` automatically at plugin initialization time.

- ddb9952: Extract auth plugin from monorepo and remove `BETTER_AUTH_URL` env dependency.

  - **Deleted `plugins/auth/`**: The auth plugin is now maintained as an external package and loaded at runtime via Module Federation. The `app.auth` entry in `bos.config.json` remains intact for runtime loading.

  - **`host/src/services/plugins.ts`**: Added `normalizeDomain(domain, env)` helper that:

    - Returns as-is if the domain already has `http://` or `https://`
    - Prepends `http://` for `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` in development
    - Prepends `https://` for everything else
    - Applied to `domain` and `hostUrl` base variables when loading the auth plugin.

  - **Removed `BETTER_AUTH_URL`**: Dropped from `.env.example` and `packages/everything-dev/src/plugin.ts` env generation. The auth plugin now derives its base URL from the normalized `hostUrl` variable passed by the host at initialization time.

## 1.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 543c595: Relaxed CORS origin check to allow any `https://` origin while still respecting `CORS_ORIGIN` for explicit allow-listing. Added `frameSrc` to the Content Security Policy to permit external `https:` frames, fixing blocked wallet iframe loads.

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- a0c5784: Upgrade `@hono/node-server` to `^2.0.1` across host and everything-dev packages.

  Bump dev dependencies group:

  - `@biomejs/biome` `2.4.10` → `2.4.14`
  - `@effect/language-service` `^0.84.3` → `^0.85.1`
  - `@electric-sql/pglite` `^0.2.0` → `^0.4.5`
  - `@vitest/ui` `4.1.2` → `4.1.5`

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- a38288d: Fix plugin error handling and shared dependency resolution in production.

  ### Host

  - Use `formatError()` instead of `error.message` when logging plugin initialization failures. Effect's `Data.TaggedError` has an empty `message` by default, so errors were appearing as `[Plugins] Error:` with no detail.
  - Mount a 503 stub router when the API plugin is unavailable, returning a proper JSON error body instead of an empty `{}` or 404.

  ### every-plugin

  - Re-throw non-ORPC errors from the `onError` interceptor so they propagate to the caller instead of being swallowed, which caused oRPC to serialize `undefined` as `{}`.

  ### Config

  - Move `better-auth` from `shared.plugins` to both `shared.ui` and `shared.plugins` in `bos.config.json` so it is shared correctly across both browser and server Module Federation boundaries.
  - Remove `drizzle-orm` from shared dependencies; it is an auth plugin implementation detail, not a runtime shared boundary.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- f185a6c: Remove `@opentelemetry/api` resolve.fallback stub.

  The package is now a direct dependency, so the `false` fallback workaround is no longer needed. Bundlers will resolve it normally.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 516376e: Make Module Federation shared dependencies config-driven and fix Docker production runtime crash.

  **Problem:** `every-plugin` hardcoded `drizzle-orm` and `better-auth` as shared MF deps, but these are app-specific packages. In Docker's isolated linker mode, `import("drizzle-orm")` from `every-plugin` failed because the generic framework package does not declare them as dependencies.

  **Solution:**

  - **Core shared deps** (`every-plugin`, `effect`, `zod`, `@orpc/contract`, `@orpc/server`) remain hardcoded in `every-plugin` — these are what the framework itself needs.
  - **App-specific shared deps** moved to `bos.config.json` under `shared.plugins` (same shape as existing `shared.ui`).
  - `ModuleFederationService` now accepts runtime `appShared` config via Effect Context (`AppSharedDepsTag`) and dynamically imports configured packages with `import(name)`.
  - `PluginRuntimeConfig` gains optional `shared` field; `PluginService.Live` threads it through the layer chain.
  - `RuntimeConfigSchema` validates `shared.plugins` alongside `shared.ui`.

  **Build-time cleanup:**

  - Removed `better-auth`/`drizzle-orm` from `pluginSharedDependencies` in `packages/every-plugin/src/build/shared-deps.ts`.
  - Host `rsbuild.config.ts` now merges `bosConfig.shared.plugins` into build-time shared deps.

  **Production startup hardening:**

  - Added preflight validation in `bos start`: checks `shared.plugins` packages are resolvable, validates required secrets from auth/api/plugin configs, warns on missing values.
  - `CORS_ORIGIN` defaults to `https://<config.domain>` when unset in production.
  - Fixed empty error messages in plugin loading by adding `formatError()` helper that properly extracts Effect Cause chains.
  - Removed duplicate secret warnings from `secretsFromEnv` — consolidated in pre-startup validation.

  **Files changed:**

  - `packages/every-plugin/src/runtime/mf-config.ts`
  - `packages/every-plugin/src/runtime/services/module-federation.service.ts`
  - `packages/every-plugin/src/runtime/services/plugin.service.ts`
  - `packages/every-plugin/src/runtime/index.ts`
  - `packages/every-plugin/src/types.ts`
  - `packages/every-plugin/src/build/shared-deps.ts`
  - `packages/everything-dev/src/types.ts`
  - `packages/everything-dev/src/plugin.ts`
  - `host/src/services/plugins.ts`
  - `host/rsbuild.config.ts`
  - `bos.config.json`

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e53af6e: Add CSP with feature flag, integrity registry, on-chain attestation, and safe plugin client factory

  CSP: Add `CSP_STRICT` const (default false) that toggles between relaxed mode (`'unsafe-inline'` + `'unsafe-eval'`) and strict mode (nonce + `'strict-dynamic'`). Relaxed mode is the default because Module Federation requires `'unsafe-eval'`, making strict inline script enforcement moot. All other CSP directives (object-src, base-uri, frame-ancestors, connect-src, etc.) remain enforced regardless of mode. When strict mode is enabled, nonces are injected into HTML script tags and the runtime config.

  Integrity: Add `IntegrityRegistry` class for SRI hash tracking, `installIntegrityFetchHook` for MF lifecycle fetch interception, `verifyConfigAgainstChain` for on-chain attestation checks, and `startIntegrityMonitor` for periodic background re-verification.

  Safety: Wrap plugin client factories with `createSafeClientFactory` to prevent arbitrary context injection. Merge CSP headers into SSR responses.

### Patch Changes

- 0a67206: Refactor dev orchestrator to service-descriptor architecture; add NEAR auth contract routes (nonce, verify, profile, relay, view); consolidate session queries in UI; add source-map devtool for plugin builds
- 34207e4: Reorganize dev port assignments: host=3000, api=3001, auth=3002, ui=3003, ui-ssr=3004, plugins=3010+

  Fix dev TUI display: host always shows "running" with port, remote non-host services show "loaded" without port. Strip ANSI codes from log files, only tag stderr as [ERR] when content is actually error-like, and replace Effect.logInfo with console.log in host logger for clean output.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ab0a308: Move auth from plugin to app-level infrastructure with oRPC contract generation

  Auth is now `app.auth` in bos.config.json instead of `plugins.auth`. The host loads the auth plugin as Phase 0 (app-level infrastructure) before other plugins. Session resolution and auth HTTP handler are provided through the auth plugin's oRPC client and initialized context, eliminating direct Better Auth coupling in the host. The `syncApiContractBridge` now generates typed auth contract clients in `api/src/plugins-client.gen.ts` and `ui/src/api-contract.gen.ts`, enabling plugins to call auth routes via `services.plugins.auth()` instead of importing the raw `Auth` type.

- 7c62044: Upgrade better-auth to 1.6.9, mature auth plugin, and add auth orchestration

  Auth plugin now uses Drizzle migrations with virtual:drizzle-migrations, Effect acquireRelease for DB lifecycle, and requires BETTER_AUTH_SECRET. Fixes API key and invitation method shapes for better-auth 1.6.9. The everything-dev CLI orchestrates auth as a first-class dev process. Host replaces Deferred with FiberHandle and resets federation state on shutdown.

- c0452e7: Renamed `productionIntegrity` to `integrity` across all schemas, build configs, and `bos.config.json`. Added `name` and `version` fields to `BosPluginRef`. Enhanced `bos plugin add` with `bos://account/plugins/name` registry resolution, manifest validation, and automatic integrity computation. Enhanced `bos plugin publish` with manifest validation, integrity computation, and FastKV plugin registry writes. Added generic KV routes (`kvGet`, `kvList`, `kvPrepareWrite`, `kvRelayWrite`) to the registry plugin.
- c29e058: Migrate auth from plugin to app-level infrastructure. Host mounts only the raw Better Auth handler; authClient is injected separately from pluginsClient. Plugins receive auth context per-request, not via injected clients. Projects plugin cleaned of auth-proxying routes. Deleted every-plugin/context.ts.

### Patch Changes

- 0dc8772: Fix host crash when accessing auth plugin initialized context
- 39588a1: Remove dead code: bootstrap script, drizzle/database infrastructure, and unused dependencies

  The host no longer has a local database — auth is handled by a runtime-loaded plugin. Removed bootstrap.ts (superseded by orchestrator's spawnRemoteHost), drizzle.config.ts (schema directory already deleted), DrizzleORMMigrations rspack plugin, $apiClient global declaration, and 11 unused dependencies (drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, better-auth, better-near-auth, @libsql/client, @proj-airi/unplugin-drizzle-orm-migrations, @t3-oss/env-core, @fastnear/near-connect, web-vitals, @tanstack/react-query, @tanstack/react-router). Cleaned up Dockerfile and .env.example accordingly.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 3627dd8: Fix production deploy EACCES errors: appuser now owns /app, /app/data, and .bos directories so runtime file creation (database.db, logs, pids) works correctly in the Docker container

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- aeab5ce: Remove demo routes and fix plugin routing. API shell now only exposes `ping` and `authHealth` (with `requireAuth` middleware). Plugin-specific routes are registered before the base API catch-all in Hono, fixing 404s on `/api/rpc/{plugin}/*`. OpenAPI spec includes the current domain as an available server.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b666191: Restructure Docker build and release pipeline

  - **Multi-stage Docker build** excludes `packages/` from the final image. The builder stage resolves `workspace:*` refs to npm versions (via `scripts/resolve-workspace-refs.ts`), installs from npm, then the final stage copies only app code + node_modules.
  - **Release pipeline** is now a single sequential job: npm publish gates Zephyr deploy and Docker build. If npm publish fails, nothing else runs.
  - **Start command** uses `bos start` (binary from npm) instead of `bun packages/everything-dev/cli.js`. Account and domain are read from `bos.config.json`.
  - **`everything-dev` and `every-plugin`** moved to `dependencies` in root `package.json` (runtime deps in Docker).
  - **`docker.yml`** is now `workflow_dispatch` only — the release workflow builds Docker inline.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d4df05d: ## Infrastructure: CI optimization, Docker hardening, staging environments, config-driven architecture

  ### CI/CD improvements

  - **Consolidated lint + typecheck** into a single job (was 2 sequential), removing ~1-2 minutes per CI run
  - **Replaced `bun lint` + `bun format:check`** with single `biome ci .` command
  - **Pinned Bun version** to `"1.4"` in all workflows (was `latest`)
  - **Added native caching** via `setup-bun@v2` cache option (removed redundant `actions/cache`)
  - **Upgraded `actions/checkout`** from v6 to v4
  - **Parallelized typecheck** across packages using background processes (`& wait`)
  - **Staging deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/staging.yml`) — builds `:staging` image on merge to main
  - **Preview deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`) — builds `:pr-N` image per PR, comments preview URL
  - **CI workflows read domain from `bos.config.json`** via `jq` instead of hardcoding

  ### Docker hardening

  - **Non-root user**: Container now runs as `appuser` (UID 1001) instead of root
  - **Layer caching**: Dependencies installed before source code copy for better cache hits
  - **Bun 1.4**: Updated base image from `oven/bun:1.3.9-alpine` to `oven/bun:1.4-alpine`
  - **Added `curl` and `/health` healthcheck** with 30s interval
  - **Removed `Dockerfile.dev`**: Development flow uses `bos dev`, not a dev Docker image
  - **Added `railway.json`** for Railway deployment configuration with health checks

  ### Staging environment support

  - **Added `staging` field** to `BosConfigSchema` for staging domain configuration
  - **Added `--env` flag** to CLI start command supporting `production` and `staging` environments
  - **Updated `start` script** to accept `APP_ENV` environment variable for environment selection
  - **Staging mode** sets `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` from `config.staging.domain` and labels process as "Staging Mode"

  ### Config-driven architecture

  `bos.config.json` is now the single source of truth. All hardcoded values have been eliminated in favor of deriving from config at runtime or build time:

  - **Removed hardcoded defaults** from `package.json` start script — `--account` and `--domain` no longer have shell fallbacks; config is read from `bos.config.json`
  - **`BETTER_AUTH_URL`** now defaults to `config.hostUrl` instead of hardcoded `localhost:3000`
  - **`fastkv.ts`** mainnet fallback uses the actual `accountId` parameter instead of hardcoded `"dev.everything.near"`
  - **Host page title** uses `config.domain` instead of hardcoded `"everything.dev"`
  - **UI app name** is injected at build time from `bos.config.json` via rsbuild `source.define` (was hardcoded `"everything.dev"` in 15+ route files)
  - **UI `about.tsx`** registry query params use `activeRuntime.accountId`/`gatewayId` instead of hardcoded values

  ### Breaking changes

  - `BOS_ACCOUNT` and `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` are no longer default-encoded in Docker image — config comes from `bos.config.json`
  - Docker `CMD` no longer passes `--account` / `--domain` — use `APP_ENV` env var to switch environments
  - `BosConfigSchema` now includes optional `staging` field — existing configs are unaffected
  - `StartOptionsSchema` now includes optional `env` field — existing invocations are unaffected
  - UI `branding.ts` `APP_NAME` now reads from `import.meta.env.APP_NAME` with `"everything.dev"` fallback

### Patch Changes

- 96a492e: Fix Docker build for nested workspaces

  Replace broken `COPY */package.json ./*/` with `COPY . .` before `bun install`, so nested workspace directories (`plugins/*/`, `packages/*/`) are present when Bun resolves workspaces. Fixes preview PR Docker builds failing with "Workspace not found".

- 7e1286a: ## Security hardening: SRI integrity, CORS tightening, and config cleanup

  ### Subresource Integrity (SRI) for remote entries

  - **New `everything-dev/integrity` module** with `computeSriHash`, `computeSriHashForUrl`, and `verifySriForUrl` — single source of truth for all integrity operations
  - **Deploy hooks** now compute SHA-384 hashes of `remoteEntry.js` and write `productionIntegrity`/`ssrIntegrity` to `bos.config.json` on deploy
  - **Client-side SRI**: `<script>` tags for remote entries now include `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes
  - **Server-side SRI verification** before loading SSR modules, API plugins, and UI federation remotes
  - **Integrity plumbing**: `productionIntegrity` and `ssrIntegrity` fields flow through `BosConfig` → `RuntimeConfig` → `ClientRuntimeConfig` → HTML rendering

  ### CORS hardening

  - **`host/src/services/auth.ts`**: Better Auth `trustedOrigins` now falls back to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]` instead of `[]` when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset, aligning with Hono CORS middleware
  - **`host/src/program.ts`**: Production warning when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset; fixed bug where empty `uiConfig.url` could be included as a CORS origin
  - **`packages/everything-dev/src/host.ts`**: CORS origins now include UI URL in fallback; production warning added
  - **Production warning** added for missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

  ### Config / type cleanup

  - **Removed `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl`** from `ClientRuntimeInfo` — these leaked arbitrary config data to the client
  - **Renamed `ActiveRuntimeInfo`** to `ClientRuntimeInfo` everywhere for consistency
  - **Deduplicated `SharedDepConfigSchema`** — now an alias for `SharedConfigSchema`
  - **Added `productionIntegrity`** to `BosConfigInput` interface, removing `as any` cast
  - **Added `testnet`** to `BosConfigSchema`

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed trailing slash inconsistency in host's SSR URL construction
  - Fixed SRI integrity check being inside Effect retry scope (now fails fast, only module loading is retried)
  - Added `integrity` verification to API plugin loading (`everything-dev/src/api.ts` and `host/src/services/plugins.ts`)

  ### Breaking changes

  - `ActiveRuntimeInfo` type removed — use `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl` removed from `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `BetterAuth` `trustedOrigins` default changed from `[]` to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]`

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 1cea1e1: Fix mixed content errors when behind reverse proxy (Railway, etc.)

  Added support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to correctly determine the request URL when the server is behind a reverse proxy. This fixes mixed content errors where HTTPS pages were making HTTP API requests.

  Also added `secureHeaders` middleware for additional security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

## 1.1.0
